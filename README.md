As a data scientist and financial analyst, I am always unsatistified with the level of optionality and customizability in pre-built budgeting softwares: so I created my own.

# Getting Started
* I am running R version 3.4.1
* Run the create_database.sql file on your computer and that will create the entire database  - views and tables.
* The backend for this is MySQL so it requires that you already have that installed on your local PC or server. Download it here: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/


# To-Do List
* Create script using Plaid to automatically pull data and input to MySQL database
* Upload some dummy data for testing
* Build predictive modeling into the script for Purchase Volume and Margin values
  * Random Forest
  * xgBoost
  * Neural Network (RNN / LSTM)
  * Regression
  * ARIMA
* Make more of UI based interaction to update budget values
