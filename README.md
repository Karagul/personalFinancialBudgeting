As a data scientist and financial analyst, I am always unsatistified with the level of optionality and customizability in pre-built budgeting softwares: so I created my own.

#Getting Started
-I am running R version 3.4.1
-Run the create_database.sql file on your computer and that will create the entire database  - views and tables.
-The backend for this is MySQL so it requires that you already have that installed on your local PC or server. Download it here: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/


#To-Do List
-Create script using Plaid to automatically pull data and input to MySQL database
-Upload some scrubd dummy data for testing
